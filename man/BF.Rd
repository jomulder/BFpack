\arguments{
\item{x}{An R object containing the outcome of a statistical analysis.
An R object containing the outcome of a statistical analysis. Currently, the
following objects can be processed: t_test(), bartlett_test(), lm(), aov(),
manova(), cor_test(), lmer() (only for testing random intercep variances),
glm(), coxph(), survreg(), polr(), zeroinfl(), rma(), ergm(), bergm(), or named
vector objects. In the case \code{x} is a named vector, the arguments \code{Sigma}
and \code{n} are also needed. See vignettes for elaborations.}

\item{hypothesis}{A character string containing the constrained (informative) hypotheses to
evaluate in a confirmatory test. The default is NULL, which will result in standard exploratory testing
under the model \code{x}.}

\item{prior.hyp.explo}{The prior probabilities of the hypotheses in the exploratory tests. Except for
objects of class \code{aov} (for (M)ANOVA, etc.), this argument should be a vector with three
elements reflecting the prior probability of a zero effect, a negative effect, and a positive effect, respectively.
For objects of class \code{aov}, the argument
should be a list where the first element should be a vector of length 3 specifying the prior probabilities of each parameter
being zero, negative, or positive, the second element should be a vector of length 2 specifying the prior probabilities
of a model where is no main effect for a factor and the full model, and the third element should be a vector of length 2
specifying the prior probabilities of a model where is no interaction effect (if present) for two factors and the full model.
The default (\code{NULL}) specifies equal prior probabilities for each hypothesis per exploratory test.}

\item{prior.hyp.conf}{The prior probabilities of the constrained hypotheses in the confirmatory test.}

\item{prior.hyp}{Deprecated. Please use the argument \code{prior.hyp.conf}.}

\item{complement}{a logical specifying whether the complement should be added
to the tested hypothesis under \code{hypothesis}.}

\item{log}{a logical specifying whether the Bayes factors should be computed on a log scale.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{Sigma}{An approximate posterior covariance matrix (e.g,. error covariance
matrix) of the parameters of interest. This argument is only required when \code{x}
is a named vector.}

\item{n}{The (effective) sample size that was used to acquire the estimates in the named vector
\code{x} and the error covariance matrix \code{Sigma}. This argument is only required when \code{x}
is a named vector.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to and from other functions.}

\item{BF.type}{An integer that specified the type of Bayes factor (or prior) that is used for the test.
Currently, this argument is only used for models of class 'lm' and 't_test',
where \code{BF.type=2} implies an adjusted fractional Bayes factor with a 'fractional prior mean' at the null value (Mulder, 2014),
and \code{BF.type=1} implies a regular fractional Bayes factor (based on O'Hagan (1995)) with a 'fractional prior mean' at the MLE.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations that are used to compute the Monte Carlo estimates
(only used for certain hypotheses under multivariate models and when testing group variances).}
}

equality constraints of a hypothesis (the prior density at the equality constraints in the
extended Savage Dickey density ratio).

order constraints of a hypothesis (the prior probability of the order constraints in the extended
Savage Dickey density ratio).

constraints of a hypothesis (the posterior density at the equality constraints in the extended
Savage Dickey density ratio).
\item The fourth column `\code{fit>}' quantifies the relative fit of the order

Savage Dickey density ratio)

'group identifiers' that were identified based on the number of unique combinations of \code{level}s
of predictor variables of class \code{factor} in the data. These group identifiers are used to automatically
specify the minimal fractions that are used to compute (adjusted) fractional Bayes factors.
\item \code{fraction_groupID_observations} (only for objects of class \code{lm}): A vector that
specifies to which 'group identifier' an observation belongs. The group identifiers are constructed
based on the unique combination of the \code{levels} based on the predictor variables of class \code{factor}
of the observations.
\item \code{call}: The call of the \code{BF} function.

\description{
The \code{BF} function can be used for hypothesis testing and
 model selection using the Bayes factor. By default exploratory hypothesis tests are
performed of whether each model parameter equals zero, is negative, or is
 positive. Confirmatory hypothesis tests can be executed by specifying hypotheses with
equality and/or order constraints on the parameters of interest. Depending on the
class of the fitted model different Bayes factors are used as described in the output.
}
\details{
The function requires a fitted modeling object. Current analyses
that are supported: \code{\link[bain]{t_test}},
\code{\link[BFpack]{bartlett_test}},
\code{\link[stats]{aov}}, \code{\link[stats]{manova}},
\code{\link[stats]{lm}}, \code{mlm},
\code{\link[stats]{glm}}, \code{\link[polycor]{hetcor}},
\code{\link[lme4]{lmer}}, \code{\link[survival]{coxph}},
\code{\link[survival]{survreg}}, \code{\link[ergm]{ergm}},
\code{\link[Bergm]{bergm}},
\code{\link[pscl]{zeroinfl}}, \code{\link[metafor]{rma}} and \code{\link[MASS]{polr}}.

For testing parameters from the results of t_test(), lm(), aov(),
manova(), and bartlett_test(), hypothesis testing is done using
adjusted fractional Bayes factors are computed (using minimal fractions).
For testing measures of association (e.g., correlations) via \code{cor_test()},
Bayes factors are computed using joint uniform priors under the correlation
matrices. For testing intraclass correlations (random intercept variances) via
\code{lmer()}, Bayes factors are computed using uniform priors for the intraclass
correlations. For all other tests,  approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factors
(with minimal fractions) are computed using Gaussian approximations, similar as
a classical Wald test.
