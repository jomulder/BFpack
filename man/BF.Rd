testing}
\usage{
BF(x, hypothesis, prior.hyp, complement, Sigma, n, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An R object containing the outcome of a statistical analysis.
An R object containing the outcome of a statistical analysis. Currently, the
following objects can be processed: t_test(), bartlett_test(), lm(), aov(),
manova(), cor_test(), lmer() (only for testing random intercep variances),
glm(), coxph(), survreg(), polr(), zeroinfl(), rma(), or named vector objects.
In the case \code{x} is a named vector, the arguments \code{Sigma} and \code{n}
are also needed. See vignettes for elaborations.}

\item{hypothesis}{A character string containing the constrained (informative) hypotheses to
evaluate in a confirmatory test. The default is NULL, which will result in standard exploratory testing
under the model \code{x}.}

\item{prior.hyp}{A vector specifying the prior probabilities of the hypotheses.
The default is NULL which will specify equal prior probabilities.}

\item{complement}{a logical specifying whether the complement should be added
to the tested hypothesis under \code{hypothesis}.}

\item{Sigma}{An approximate posterior covariance matrix (e.g,. error covariance
matrix) of the parameters of interest. This argument is only required when \code{x}
is a named vector.}

\item{n}{The (effective) sample size that was used to acquire the estimates in the named vector
\code{x} and the error covariance matrix \code{Sigma}. This argument is only required when \code{x}
is a named vector.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to and from other functions.}
}
\value{
The output is an object of class \code{BF}. The object has elements:
\itemize{
\item BFtu_exploratory: The Bayes factors of the constrained hypotheses against
the unconstrained hypothesis in the exploratory test.
\item PHP_exploratory: The posterior probabilities of the constrained hypotheses
in the exploratory test.
\item BFtu_confirmatory: The Bayes factors of the constrained hypotheses against
the unconstrained hypothesis in the confirmatory test using the \code{hypothesis}
argument.
\item PHP_confirmatory: The posterior probabilities of the constrained hypotheses
in the confirmatory test using the \code{hypothesis} argument.
\item BFmatrix_confirmatory: The evidence matrix which contains the Bayes factors
between all possible pairs of hypotheses in the confirmatory test.
\item BFtable_confirmatory: The \code{Specification table} (output when printing the
\code{summary} of a \code{BF} for a confirmatory test) which contains the different
elements of the extended Savage Dickey density ratio where
\itemize{
\item The first column `\code{complex=}' quantifies the relative complexity of the
equality constraints of a hypothesis (the prior density at the equality constraints in the
extended Savage Dickey density ratio).
\item The second column `\code{complex>}' quantifies the relative complexity of the
order constraints of a hypothesis (the prior probability of the order constraints in the extended
Savage Dickey density ratio).
\item The third column `\code{fit=}' quantifies the relative fit of the equality
constraints of a hypothesis (the posterior density at the equality constraints in the extended
Savage Dickey density ratio).
\item The fourth column `\code{fit>}' quantifies the relative fit of the order
constraints of a hypothesis (the posterior probability of the order constraints in the extended
Savage Dickey density ratio)
\item The fifth column `\code{BF=}' contains the Bayes factor of the equality constraints
against the unconstrained hypothesis.
\item The sixth column `\code{BF>}' contains the Bayes factor of the order constraints
against the unconstrained hypothesis.
\item The seveth column `\code{BF}' contains the Bayes factor of the constrained hypothesis
against the unconstrained hypothesis.
\item The eigth column `\code{BF=}' contains the posterior probabilities of the
constrained hypotheses.
}
\item prior: The prior probabilities of the constrained hypotheses in a confirmatory test.
\item hypotheses: The tested constrained hypotheses in a confirmatory test.
\item estimates: The unconstrained estimates.
\item model: The input model \code{x}.
\item call: The call of the \code{BF} function.
}
}
\description{
The \code{BF} function can be used for hypothesis testing and
 model
selection using the Bayes factor. By default exploratory hypothesis tests are
performed of whether each model parameter equals zero, is negative, or is
 positive.
Confirmatory hypothesis tests can be executed by specifying hypotheses with
equality and/or order constraints on the parameters of interest.
}
\details{
The function requires a fitted modeling object. Current analyses
that are supported: \code{\link[bain]{t_test}},
\code{\link[BFpack]{bartlett_test}},
\code{\link[stats]{aov}}, \code{\link[stats]{manova}},
\code{\link[stats]{lm}}, \code{mlm},
\code{\link[stats]{glm}}, \code{\link[polycor]{hetcor}},
\code{\link[lme4]{lmer}}, \code{\link[survival]{coxph}},
\code{\link[survival]{survreg}},
\code{\link[pscl]{zeroinfl}}, \code{\link[metafor]{rma}} and \code{\link[MASS]{polr}}.

For testing parameters from the results of t_test(), lm(), aov(),
manova(), and bartlett_test(), hypothesis testing is done using
adjusted fractional Bayes factors are computed (using minimal fractions).
For testing measures of association (e.g., correlations) via \code{cor_test()},
Bayes factors are computed using joint uniform priors under the correlation
matrices. For testing intraclass correlations (random intercept variances) via
\code{lmer()}, Bayes factors are computed using uniform priors for the intraclass
correlations. For all other tests,  approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factors
(with minimal fractions) are computed using Gaussian approximations, similar as
a classical Wald test.
